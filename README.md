# Calendar

## Description

Scheduling calendar with dynamic time slots

This project was to exercise my ability to dynamically update a webpage using a server-side API.

This calendar will change the background color of time slots based on the current time of day.

It will save all inputs to local storage, and retain them upon refreshing the page. 

I find forms to be a consistently challenging concept for myself, so I'm going to continue working on this project after deployment to see if I can find a more efficient way to structure the HTML and javascript.

Additionally, I want to reduce my lines of code in the javascript and create a function to handle saving each individual time block.
